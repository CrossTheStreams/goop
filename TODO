Establishing some global Clock. I'm not sure how it would be implemented, but
the idea is that you can (for example) fire some event with not-perfect
precision, and it should sync up to the next "beat", to enable better live
playback.

Some type of Pattern abstraction. You should be able to define some kind of
note-sequence (Event-sequence?) which will be fired against some target on a
regular basis.

Modifier Events. Now, you must specify (eg.) hz = 440. But I want to be able to
say hz = hz + 10 (or equivalent). There must be some range involved as well:
the values shouldn't get above MAX or below MIN. And then, should they cycle,
or just stop?  If cycling, how? MAX+1 yielding MIN, or MAX+1 yielding MAX-1 and
a change of 'direction'?

Note equivalences. A4 = 440.0.

Proper bimodal UI, input/output panels.

Tab completion (complex!)

OSC integration
